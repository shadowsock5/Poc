影响范围：
- Grafana instances up to 7.5.11 and 8.1.5
```
/api/snapshots/:key
/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey

```

>   description: Grafana instances up to 7.5.11 and 8.1.5 allow remote unauthenticated users to view the snapshot associated with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths /api/snapshot/:key or /dashboard/snapshot/:key. If the snapshot is in public mode, unauthenticated users can delete snapshots by accessing the endpoint /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Authenticated users can also delete snapshots by accessing the endpoints /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, or sending a delete request to /api/snapshot/:key, regardless of whether or not the snapshot is set to public mode (disabled by default).
